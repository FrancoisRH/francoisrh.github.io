									<h1>Creating a website<br />
									From scratch</h1>
									<p>One day I woke up asking myself if I could create a website from scratch.<br />
									I got on my keyboard and started typing.<br />
									The result isn’t disappointing.</p>

								<p>I remember when I started recruiting Developers in 2013. At the time, I was a junior Recruiter in London, I worked in a startup and I was looking for a PHP profile. I didn’t even know what PHP was. I couldn’t tell the different between PHP and HTML. I didn’t even know what PHP meant.
                I knew nothing. So, I decided to learn.</p> 
                
		<p><b>Learning to code</b></p>
                I took a programming class. I wanted to understand what programming is. I learnt HTML basics. I passed the exam, I remember writing HTML code with a pencil on a white piece of paper, to recreate a web page they printed on another piece of paper. I guess that’s the most frustrating way to write code – <i>but hey, you have to start somewhere, right?</i><br>
                I learned VBA in Excel, too. I Learned the basics of algorithmic: while loops, if, then, end, etc. I understood what it feels like to find solutions to problems that you thought you would never solve. I understood what coding was about – or at least, I knew enough to pretend I know what is it like to be a Developer.</p>
                
                <p><b>From Programming to Recruitment</b></p>
                It’s been a few years I am recruiting all kinds of technical profiles. Developers. Engineering Managers. QA Testers. Frontend. Backend. Full stack. Database Administrators. DevOps. Technical Leads. All kinds of technical profiles. I had to learn – a lot. I am still learning. Languages, frameworks, libraries, tools and methodologies, lingo and trends.<br>
                When you leave school, learning isn’t as easy as it was. Nobody asks you to sit on a chair to attend classes for 8 hours straight. You must find tricks to keep learning. So, I decided to learn more about programming, not by reading books and attending classes, but by programming. Easy as that.</p>
                
                <p><b>From Recruitment to Programming</b></p>
                I decided to create my own website. It is a static, HTML-based, open source copycat of a template I found online. I rearranged everything, simplified the code, added pictures, created templates, linked the pages between each other, wrote a few articles to make sure there is enough content. <br>
                It helped me understand what it is like to code, not only because your teacher asks you to, but because you want to. I better understand Developers that contribute to open source projects. I better understand Developers, period.<br>
                This website is basic. At least 50% of the codebase of this website was written by someone else – <i>but hey, you have to start somewhere, right?</i></p>
