								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/sourcecon-paris.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								
                <p>Doctolib hosted the 3rd session of #SourceCon in Paris. After the first chapter at Algolia, and the 2nd chapter at Station F, Tris Revill and Rassam Yaghmaei opened Doctolib's doors to paris' Recruiters and Sourcers, so we can all share a great moment discussing the state of Sourcing in France - and even in Switzerland!</p>
		<p>Thank you Doctolib for hosting this great event, and obviously, thank you Tris and Rassam for putting so much energy in growing the SourceCon community in France. You guys are doing an amazing work!</p>
		<p>Below, you will find a recap about what have been said and done at Doctolib during the event - have a great time reading the article!</p>

		<p><b>Introduction:</b> Rassam explained how he hired Tris as Global Sourcing Manager – it is all about seizing the opportunity in front of you.</p>

                <p><h3Rassam Yaghmaei & Tris Revill – Do you eat your own dog food?</h3></p>
                <p>Doctolib want to “raise the bar” in recruitment, so they are really picky regarding Engineers. It means: leveraging how we recruit Recruiters, who will recruit Engineers in the end. When you set up a sourcing team, you must recruit a lot of Recruiters – that’s the reason Rassam and Tris designed a tool to assess, train and develop Recruiters at Doctolib.</p>
                
                <p><b>Levels Rassam and Tris designed: </b></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Level 1: Junior Recruiter</li>
                  <li>Level 2: Confirmed Recruiter</li>
                  <li>Level 3: Confirmed Recruiter</li>
                  <li>Level 4: Lead Recruiter</li>
                 </ul>
                 
                 <p>They are designing their internal training according to this ladder.</p>
                 <p>In each level, you have 5 core competencies.</p>
                                 
                <p><b>5 core competencies: </b></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Sourcing: strategy, engagement & data mapping</li>
                  <li>Collaboration: referrals & stakeholders management</li>
                  <li>Sales: cold calling, pitching, convincing</li>
                  <li>Resilience: auto-analysis, consistency and autonomy</li>
                  <li>Market knowledge</li>
                 </ul>
                 
                 <p>They broke down every core competency into small blocks, divided in level 1, 2, 3 and 4</p>
                 
                 <p>They don’t expect a Recruiter to be “level 2” or “level 3” everywhere, it is only a map to have a 360° vision about where each Recruiter is standing. </p>
                 <p>This tool helped them assess candidates in the interview process: at the end of the process, they can clearly express a ‘go’ or a ‘nogo’ on a profile, according to the matrix they implemented.</p>
                 
                 <p><b>Interview process for a Recruiter at Doctolib:</b></p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Phone screen</li>
                    <li>Case study</li>
                    <li>Case restitution</li>
                    <li>Pairing challenge: thinking with someone the same level as the candidate, working together for 2 hours, it could be sourcing, interviewing, working on a job description… </li>
                    <li>Immersion</li>
                    <li>Hire/no hire</li>
                   </ul>

                 <p><h3>Sourcing panel with Mathilde Kurzawa from Heetch, Noé Antona from SonarSource, Katia Bonfante from Ornikar, Lisa Saucourt from Doctolib: 5 things I want to know about sourcing in France!</h3></p>
                 
                 <p><b>What language do you write search strings in?</b></p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>French and / or English: 47,5%</li>
                    <li>French: 16%</li>
                    <li>English: 36,5%</li>
                   </ul>
                  
                  <p>Noé is based in Switzerland, and he is surprised by the number of French Sourcers writing search strings in English. </p>
                  <p>Katia is searching profiles in Germany, and she is writing search strings in English and German. When she is looking for profiles in Spain, as Spanish people speak poor English, she is writing search strings 100% in Spanish. </p>
                  
                  
                  <p><b>Where do you like to source?</b></p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>LinkedIn: 67,3%</li>
                    <li>Google: ~15%</li>
                    <li>Amazing hiring: 3,6%</li>
                    <li>Slack: 1,8%</li>
                    <li>GitHub: 5,5%</li>
                    <li>Where my target is: 1,8%</li>
                    <li>A few other channels: …</li>
                   </ul>

                  <p>Lisa asked 50 Developers at Doctolib where they would go to look for a job: the clear majority told her they would open their LinkedIn inbox and look at what comes to them. So, it looks like LinkedIn is still a reliable source of profiles after all.</p>
                  <p>Katia told us about recruiting tech profiles at a bar or recruiting in meetups is a basic for her: she is surprised meetups and community events do not appear in the survey.</p>
                  <p>Noé highlights that if every Recruiter is sourcing Developers on LinkedIn, and there is only a few Developers available on LinkedIn, then we should be aware that there is a lot of competition on this channel. 
                  Regarding Google: Google is the journey, we use google to find profiles on other platforms.
                  Noé also told us about behavioral sourcing: “sourcing is about building personas”, he says. You’re not looking for skills or keywords anymore, you’re looking for behaviors you can track online or offline. How do the people matching my personas are behaving? This is the question the Sourcers should ask themselves. </p>
                  
                  
                  <p><b>Top words that appear in job titles</b></p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>sourcer: 11%</li>
                    <li>Talent: 49%</li>
                    <li>Recruiter: 39%</li>
                   </ul>
                   
                   <p>So, what is the difference between sourcing, recruitment and talent acquisition?</p>
                   <p>Lisa: First, Recruiter and Sourcer are two different kind of jobs. The Sourcer gives tools to the Recruiter to hire. The Recruiter is interviewing and closing. But she has no clue about what “Talent Acquisition” means, everyone has a different job title nowadays.</p>
                   <p>Katia: A Recruiter can be a Sourcer too, it happens often. She is a Talent Acquisition Manager on her contract, it is just a fancy name we give to Recruiters in startup.</p>
                   <p>The Talent Acquisition Manager from Dashlane reacted, he has a job larger than sourcing and recruitment: managing the relation with the Execs, managing quality of the hires, scaling the processes, implementing tools for hiring managers, training Recruiters (they are named Talent Acquisition Specialists actually). The discussion almost ended up in an octogone sans règles.</p>
                   
                   <p><b>What is your biggest challenge?</b></p>
                   <p>“Treat people like you would like to be treated” Katia says.</p>
                   <p>Lisa: personalization is key to creating engagement. Personalization is not only about leaving a blank in a template, it is also about googling people, looking for their blog, sending personalized messages… Like a message per month, sharing high-valued content, videos, articles… just to keep in touch. You’re creating engagement. Nurture your talent pool and convert them later. </p>
                   <p>Noé: personalization is OK for low volume sourcing. Finding people and getting a response is not hard when you are sourcing at small scale. If you are sourcing a large number of people, this is different.</p>
                   <p>Rassam: personalization is not the only way to convert people. Who is a professional Sourcer in the room and not personalize his message? This is the basics. Conversion depends on so much more than your personalization: your brand, for example.
                   The conversation was then about the well knows Twitter hashtag #LaPersonnalisationBordel (link) and there was a short yet virulent debate about Sourcers that are bragging online.</p>
                   <p>Katia was the very first recruiter at Ornikar, before her there was no good practice for recruitment and sourcing. You can’t ask Execs to apply best practices. </p>
                   <p>Mathilde: employer branding + personalization can do a great job together.</p>
                   
                   <p><b>The state of compensation for Recruiters and Sourcers in France: how much does a Sourcer/Recruiter makes a year on average?</b></p>
                   <p>Rassam: There is a big opportunity for good Sourcers and Recruiters to go freelance and get a lot of money. The French market is mainly composed of poor Recruiters and Sourcers. If you are looking for a permanent job, then go to companies that pay you fairly. </p>
