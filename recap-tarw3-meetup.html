		<p>Criteo hosted the 3rd edition of its "Talent Acquisition in the Real World" meetup, with awesome speakers talking about fascinating topics - as always. Thanks for contributing so much to the Talent Acquisition ecosystem in Paris!</p>
		<p>Here is a recap about what has been said this evening, powerful ideas and great punchlines :)</p>

		<p><h3>üìÉ Sell vs. test: who's interviewing who?<br>
		üé§ Alison Eastaway - Head of Talent Acquisition at Sqreen</h3></p><br />

		<p><b>"Great talent is always a seller‚Äôs market", Alison says.</b>
                <ul>
			<li><b>Positive side of Paris</b>: we got great engineering schools, and talent are loyals (3 years on average, versus 11 months in the bay area), and relatively affordable. It isn‚Äôt hard to stand out of the crowd for a Recruiter, it is easy to be a decent recruiter.</li>
			<li><b>Negative side of Paris</b>: startup / devtools market is relatively young. Lots of competition for the same profiles. </li>
                </ul></p>
                
                <p>Being a candidate is not a job.
                There are different kinds of candidates: people looking urgently for a job; people who want to move on and will take their time; people waiting to be contacted for the very right opportunity.</p><br>
                
		<p><b>Why spend so much time on the hiring processes?</b>
                <ul>
                <li>Give candidates the information they need, to enthusiastically choose us</li>
                <li>Gather the information we need, to enthusiastically choose candidates</li>
                </ul></p>
				<br>
                
                <p><b>What does a candidate need to know before joining?</b>
                <ul>
                <li>What will I be doing everyday (job descripton)?</li>
                <li>Who will I work for (manager, founder) and with (colleagues in/direct)?</li>
                <li>What is the industry, market, vision (area of interest)?</li>
                <li>How will this job get me closer to my personnal goals (growth, learning)?</li>
                <li>Will it meet my needs (Maslow's hierarchy)?</li>
                </ul></p>
				<br>
                
                <p><em>"Startup fail to sell jobs to candidates because they sell the top of Maslow‚Äôs pyramid ‚Äì candidates have no use of a huge meaning in their job if they can‚Äôt pay their rent."</em></p>
                		<br>     
                <p><b>What do we need to know before hiring a candidate?</b>
                <ul>
                <li>Can they do the job (skills, knowledge)?</li>
                <li>Will they enjoy working with us and vice versa (team interactions, common values)?</li>
                <li>Do they get the 'bigness' of our mission (area of interest)?</li>
                <li>Will they help my company improve (level up, add new skills, perspectives)?</li>
                <li>Can we meet their needs (Maslow's hierarchy)?</li>
                </ul></p>
				<br>
                
                <p><b>Rule of thumb @ Sqreen</b>
                <ul>
                <li>Be aware of bias</li>
                <li>several interactions on different days</li>
                <li>Multiple interviews</li>
                <li>Different ways of testing (Q&A, take-home test, practical on-the-spot test)</li>
                <li>Gateways: steps are pass/fail</li>
                </ul></p>
                		<br>
                <p>Process should be timely, intelligent, pleasant and defendable (you can explain why you refuse an application for 10 minutes).</p>
                		<br>
                <p><b>How much time on selling, versus how much time on testing?</b>
                <ul>
                <li>All sell: nope. People tend to ask no question</li>
                <li>All test: nope. Like reacting on the stress over a hardcore phone call.</li>
                </ul></p>
                
                <p>It takes some time to balance sell and test. Before the interview, ask yourself what the 3 topics are you want to explore. Prepare 3 questions that you can rephrase.</p>

		<p><h3>üìÉ Improve Hiring in Criteo's R&D with contributions from our engineers <br>
		üé§ Nicolas Truchi - Senior Engineer Manager at Criteo </h3></p><br>
		
		<p>Steve Jobs has a saying that A players hire A players; B players hire C players; and C players hire D players. It doesn't take long to get to Z players.</p>

		<p>Tune your hiring process the right way, to select A players. Also, you don‚Äôt only need A players.
			<p><b>Challenge #1:</b> keep the same expectations about the people we hire, as we grow</p>
			<p><b>Challenge #2:</b> there is a lot of competition on the market. You want your candidates to have a good experience because they will refer friends</p>
			<p><b>Challenge #3:</b> interview at scale. ~140 interviewers. 40+ skype interviews / week. 25+ on site interviews / week</p>
		</p>

		<p>What are we looking for in a candidate? Knowing if this person will be a top performer in the job. This is a prediction challenge. </p>

		<p><b>Best predictors of actual job performance: </b><p>
			<ul>
				<li>29%: work sample test (replicate a real piece of work)</li>
				<li>26%: general cognitive ability test (IQ test, SAT‚Ä¶)</li>
				<li>26%: structured interviews</li>
				<li>14%: unstructured interviews</li>
			</ul>
		<p>(source: Schmidt & Hunter analysis, 1998)</p>

		<p><b>Criteo tries to have interviews rounds that make sense </b></p>
		<p><b>Structured interviews:</b> behavioral questions (tell me about a time when you had to‚Ä¶?) and situational questions (what would you do if‚Ä¶?)</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Consistent across interviews</li>
				<li>Reduced bias</li>
				<li>Fair to candidates</li>
			</ul>
		<p>Whiteboard interviews: to check if the person understand what they are doing and if they can go further, not only if they have the answer to your questions.</p>
	
		<p><b>Scaling interviews</b></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Individual contributors are interviewing, and they are interviewing often ‚Äì individual contributors tend to YOLO it, they have a hard time accepting the structured interview philosophy.</li>
				<li>Managers may not interview their new hires ‚Äì this is something that is difficult to explain to managers.</li>
			</ul>

		<p><h3>üìÉ Recruiting is not only about having great recruiters<br>
		üé§ Alison Vannier - Lead R&D Recruiter at Datadog</h3></p><br>

		<p>Datadog is a SaaS based monitoring platform, bringing data from different sources to make the data more visible for the client. 1200 people, 200 people in Paris, 20 location. <br>
		Recruiting is not only words, tools, processes, it is not only about having great Recruiters. Marketing, Coordinators, Human Resources‚Ä¶ These stakeholders impact the recruiting process.</p>
	
		<p><b>Early stage:</b></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Recruiting is the responsibility of the whole company. Finding people at different life stage of the company is the responsibility of the people of the company, from the early stage to the IPO. </li>
				<li>‚ÄúBad ass session‚Äù at Datadog to help grow the sourcing pipeline when recruiters encounter issues building the pipeline. </li
				<li>The first Recruiter did not take paid time off for 2 years.</li>
			</ul>
	
		<p><b>Mid stage:</b></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Growing the team,</li>
				<li>Recruiting recruiters</li>
			</ul>
	
		<p><b>Scalability:</b></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Creating reports, documentations, analytics</li>
				<li>Stakeholders know when it is the right time set up interviews etc.</li>
			</ul>
	
		<p><i>Recruiting is not all about having great recruiters‚Ä¶ but come on, it helps, right? ‚Äì Alison Vannier</i></p><br>

		<p><h3>üìÉ Building a high performing TA team<br>
		üé§ Nate Phelps, Senior Director Global S&O TA at Criteo</h3></p>
	
		<p>Nate lived in 4 different countries: Sidney, London, Singapore, and now Paris. <br>
		Nate wore a lot of hats in HR: HR consulting, total rewards, recruiting, mobility‚Ä¶ <br>
		Nate is looking for everything wich is not related to technology at Criteo: Sales, Operations, Creative Services, Global Services, Finance, Procurement, People‚Ä¶ </p>
	
		<p><b>Nate‚Äôs Team: </b></p>
			<ul>
				<li>31 Recruiters and Talent Acquisition Ops</li>
				<li>6 TA hubs worldwide</li>
				<li>800+ hired in 2018 for the commercial part of the business</li>
				<li>110%: team productivity as % YTD</li>
			</ul>
	
		<p>Performance is important to Nate because he worked in several organizations, all size. How do we quantify performance? Mostly checking ‚Äúoutput‚Äù. Some organization define performance as volume (how many people did you hired?), as speed (how fast did you recruit people?), and some as quality. Nate never found a company that combined these 3 aspects. <br>
		To Nate, it really comes down to the input. Empowerment, accountability and recognition. <br>
			<ul>
				<li>More empowerment ==> volume</li>
				<li>More accountability ==> speed</li>
				<li>More recognition ==> quality</li>
			</ul>
	
		<p>Nate joined Criteo in Singapore in 2016, it was crazy and chaotic. He experienced tremendous growth. The team needed to adopt a common language. They needed to leverage data to manage performance, and thus drive accountability. Finally, the team moved beyond core performance, thinking ‚Äòabove of beyond‚Äô. </p><br>
	
		<i>‚ÄúA Recruitment team speaks to more people outside of the company than a Marketing team does‚Äù </i><br>
	
		<p><b>Empower the team</b></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Consult ‚Äì talk to your customers ‚Äì what do they want? </li>
			<li>Inform ‚Äì use your experience ‚Äì what do you know needs to change?</li>
			<li>Engage ‚Äì involve your Recruiters ‚Äì what is their perspective from the front line?</li>
			<li>Agree ‚Äì alignment is important ‚Äì validate your approach with the team to ensure commitment</li>
			<li>Manage ‚Äì hold people accountable ‚Äì no consequences = no incentive to change </li>	
		</ul>
	
		<p><b>Manage Performance > Drive Accountability</b></p>
		<p>Criteo introduced Recruiter Scorecard. What volume of Recruiters do I have to have to deliver a reasonable volume and quality?</p>
	
		<b>Scorecard content:</b>
			<ul>
				<li>Offers accepted</li>	
				<li>Offers declined</li>	
				<li>Offers declined </li>	
				<li>Average time thorough pipeline</li>	 
				<li>Average req time</li>	
				<li>Average posting time to fill</li>	
				<li>Source of hire</li>	
				<li>Candidate experience survey</li>	
				<li>Hiring manager survey</li>	
				<li>LinkedIn Recruiter Index</li>	
		</ul>

		<p>It is not black or white, there is a fair use of the dashboard and a deep understanding of the amount of work of each Recruiter. </p>
	

		<p><b>Evolve Behaviors > Adapt Recognition</b></p>
		<b>Early stage: </b>
			<ul>
				<li>Direct response to behaviors,</li>
				<li>Visible and frequent,</li>
				<li>Immediate,</li>
				<li>Material recognition,</li>
			</ul>
	
		<b>Mature stage:</b>
			<ul>
				<li>Reflect outcome of changed behaviors,</li>
				<li>Visible and frequent,</li>
				<li>Soft recognition (development, career opportunities‚Ä¶),</li>
			</ul>
